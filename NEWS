Version 0.8
Changes to previous version
- Restructured C implementation of PELT to remove unnecessary function calls (minor speed improvement)
- Updated FTSE100 data

Version 0.7.1
Changes to previous version
- added BIC1, SIC1, AIC1, Hannan-Quinn1 penalties (counting the changepoint as a parameter in contrast to BIC, SIC, AIC, Hannan-Quinn which do not)

Version 0.7
Changes to previous version
- added change in Poisson distribution to cpt.meanvar

Version 0.6.1
Changes to previous version
- removed plotting of "n" as a changepoint for changes in variance
- changed array allocation to calloc in PELT C code
- added checks to C code for user interruption (including appropriate memory handling)

Version 0.6
Changes to previous version
- PELT algorithms now run using C code
- Binary Segmentation algorithms now run using C code

Version 0.5
Changes to previous version
- added namespace to comply with R 2.13

Version 0.4.2
Changes to previous version
- corrected mismatch in default values for mu

Version 0.4.1
Changes to previous version
- changed default value of the mu parameter from -1000 to NA

Version 0.4
Changes to previous version
- removed regression for Normal distributed errors
- added cusum for change in mean
- added cusum of squares for change in variance
- added some datasets
- corrected plotting of Gamma and Exponential distributions in cpt.meanvar

Version 0.3
Changes to previous version
- added change in regression for Normal distributed errors

Version 0.2.1
Changes to previous version
- fixed multiple optimal changepoint bug in multiple algorithms

Version 0.2
Changes to previous version
- added change in scale parameter of Gamma distribution to cpt.meanvar
- added change in Exponential distribution to cpt.meanvar
