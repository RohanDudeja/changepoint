Version 1.0
***********
Changes to previous version
- Removed printing and plotting of the last observation as the last cpt
- The distribution class slot for the cpt class has been rename to test.stat (backwards compatability remains - for now)
- Changed value parameter in all functions to be pen.value (no backwards compatability for named variables but ordering of arguments remains the same)
- The data.set slot of the cpt class is now a ts object, the repurcusions of this are:
		* the data.set() extractor function still returns a vector (for backwards compatability)
		* a new data.set.ts() extractor function has been created that returns the ts object
		* the plot method associated with the cpt object uses the ts structure and thus the plot method for ts objects (i.e. automatic line plots)
- Created a coef method for cpt objects that returns the same as the param.est() extractor function (which remains for backwards compatibility)
- Created a logLik method for cpt objects that returns the same as the likelihood() method (which remains for backwards compatibility)
- The cpts() extractor function no longer returns the length of the data as the final changepoint.  Instead it returns the changepoints only or an empty vector to indicate no changepoints.

Version 0.8
***********
Changes to previous version
- Restructured C implementation of PELT to remove unnecessary function calls (minor speed improvement)

- Added Lai2005fig3 and Lai2005fig4 data

Version 0.7.1
*************
Changes to previous version
- added BIC1, SIC1, AIC1, Hannan-Quinn1 penalties (counting the changepoint as a parameter in contrast to BIC, SIC, AIC, Hannan-Quinn which do not)

***********
Changes to previous version
- added change in Poisson distribution to cpt.meanvar

Version 0.6.1
*************
Changes to previous version
- removed plotting of "n" as a changepoint for changes in variance
- changed array allocation to calloc in PELT C code
- added checks to C code for user interruption (including appropriate memory handling)

Version 0.6
***********
Changes to previous version
- PELT algorithms now run using C code
- Binary Segmentation algorithms now run using C code

Version 0.5
***********

***********
Changes to previous version
- removed regression for Normal distributed errors
- added cusum for change in mean
- added cusum of squares for change in variance
- added some datasets
- corrected plotting of Gamma and Exponential distributions in cpt.meanvar

Version 0.3
***********

Version 0.2.1
*************
Changes to previous version
- fixed multiple optimal changepoint bug in multiple algorithms

Version 0.2
***********
